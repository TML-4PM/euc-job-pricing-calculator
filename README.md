🚀 EUC Job Pricing Calculator – Because Math is Hard
(...and quoting shouldn’t feel like quantum physics.)

📢 What is this?
Have you ever tried to calculate a quote for IT hardware and thought:
"Wow, I wish this was as fun as watching paint dry!"
Yeah… neither have we.

So, we built the EUC Job Pricing Calculator! 🎉
It’s a magical (read: JavaScript-powered) tool that helps you:
✅ Quote laptops, keyboards, monitors, headsets, and more!
✅ Generate professional-looking PDF quotes (so you look important).
✅ Track all quotes in CSV format (because spreadsheets are life).
✅ Integrate with scheduling & email input, because automation is cool.
✅ Upsell customers on SmartAssist subscriptions (extra revenue = extra coffee ☕).

💡 How It Works
1️⃣ User picks products from a carefully curated list.
2️⃣ The system does math (better than your old calculator).
3️⃣ Instant quote appears with the ability to download a PDF.
4️⃣ CSV tracking saves all quotes, because data is king.
5️⃣ Profit? (We’re still working on that part.)

🛠️ Features
Handles Email Input 📩 (Because you can’t send quotes via smoke signals.)
Unknown Items? No problem! ⚠️ (They get labeled "Special Order – POA" because mystery is fun!)
SmartAssist Upsells 🧠💰 (Because who doesn’t love extra support for $19.99/month?)
Stylish PDF Quotes 📄 (Branded, tax-compliant, and fancy enough for execs.)
CSV Aggregation 📊 (For when you want to geek out over sales data.)
🤓 Tech Stack
🚀 Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (the usual suspects)
⚡ Backend: Express.js, Serverless Functions (sounds fancy, right?)
💾 Data: JSON-based product catalog (because databases are for overachievers)
🖨️ PDF Generation: (Because quotes printed on napkins are not legally binding.)
📈 CSV Export: (For the spreadsheet enthusiasts among us.)
